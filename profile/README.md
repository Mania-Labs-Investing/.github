## Company History
<!-- Part of what makes your company unique is its history. And, even startups have some history. Don’t put too much focus on this section, but do add some personality and interesting details if possible, especially if they relate to your company culture. -->

Mania Labs had its beginings going back to 2020, with a group of friends that wanted to apply analytics to some problems in every day life. One of the initial explorations into this hobby was focused on using ML to predict an optimal March Madness bracket. At the time this was a popular [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/data), this link is to a more recent iteration of said contest. Some success found in a local bracket despite our lack of backetball knowledge served to propel us into new endevaours. After some sub par 401K performance, the new focus of attention became more informed investing. In this we had found one of the most challenging yet fullfilling problems yet to attempt. 

## Mission Statement
<!-- Your company’s mission statement should be included in the company overview. If you don’t yet have a company mission statement, that’s okay. Think of a mission statement as the purpose of your company.

If you don’t have one, you can create one with your team. Or you can simply replace the mission statement with a problem statement. Your business idea should exist to solve a problem or pain point faced by your customers. Share what that problem is and what your business does to solve it. That’s essentially your mission statement. -->
Mania Labs chases honorable pursuits to create wealth, improve the world for others, and see the world improved beyond our years. We look for ways to benefit our lives and families that also benefit others.


## Products & Services
<!-- This section of the company overview is where you can share the nitty-gritty details of your business. Talk about what product or service you provide and to whom you provide it. You can share some numbers here, but in general, save the numbers for later in your business plan.

The company overview should give the reader a general understanding of your business, your product or service, and your customer. If they’re interested to know more, they’ll reach out to you for a meeting or take the time to read the rest of your business plan. Keep it simple and straightforward here. -->

Mania Labs LLC is comprised primarily of a team of analytics professionals. We provide two primary services centered around analytics, consultation and contract work and ML driven investment products.

### Analytics Contracts

Mania Labs contains a breadth of analytics experience across our core team. We have trained and mentored entry level data scientists and engineers, managed a diverse team of analytics professionals, and taken many complex programs from ideation to production level deployment. Given this exeperience, we are very well suited for providing value and mentorship through analytics engagements. We are transparent with our process and approach, look forward to propogating best practies through our work with customers, and aim to leave customers more enabled and armed with tools to provide maximum value back to their organization even after our engagemnet has finisihed.  

We believe in a value based model, as it works in the best interest of both us (Mania Labs LLC) and our customers. Core to this model, is that we work with our customers to scope out their project success metric and couple it directly to their bottom line. Once this metric has been defined we work together to understand the current state, and project conservative numbers around what value could be generated from completing the program. Part of our cost for completing the program is then tied directly to this success metric.

While scoping the project, part of projecting the expected value returned is to tie that to the cost of the program. This makes for a clear picture into realized ROI for our customers, and allows them to easily propose and discuss the project with their executive management if need be. Multiple scenarios are then laid out with a fixed ROI for the customer, giving complete transparency to cost while painting a full picture of what could be achieved. Given that the ROI is fixed, it serves to incentivize both us (Mania Labs LLC) and our customer to acheive the optimal value out of the program. Approaching from this mindset helps to gain support from upper management, and ensure quick and lasting priority while moving through the final implementation phase. 

### ML Driven Investment Products

## Future Goals
<!-- While concrete details and facts about your business are important to whoever is reading your company overview, it’s also important to share your dreams and your vision. If you’re writing a business plan for a business that’s already in place, it’s very likely you’re looking for business financing to scale or solve a business problem. If you’re just starting out, though, then it’s likely you’re hoping to find startup funding.

The section on your future business goals should include a brief description of your growth goals for your business. Where you are now tells the reader a lot, but they also want to know where you plan to go. -->
